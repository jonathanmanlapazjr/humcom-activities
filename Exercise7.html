<h3> Spongebob</h3>
<img src="Spongebob.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="250px"  height="250px"/>
<p><br>The character-driven cartoon chronicles the nautical and often nonsensical adventures of SpongeBob,</br> 
    an incurably optimistic and earnest sea sponge, and his underwater friends. Dwelling a few fathoms</br>
    beneath the tropical isle of Bikini Atoll in the sub-surface city of Bikini Bottom,</br> 
    SpongeBob lives in a two-story pineapple. Instead of taking the logical approach to everyday challenges,</br>
    SpongeBob approaches life in a wayward and unconventional way.</br> 
    Whether searching for the ultimate spatula to perfect his burger flipping technique</br>
    at the Krusty Krab or just hanging out with his best friend Patrick (an amiable starfish),</br>
    SpongeBob's good intentions and overzealous approach to life usually create chaos in his underwater world.</br></p>
